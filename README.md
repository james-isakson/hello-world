# hello-world

Greetings Humans!

James-isakson here.  I am working my way back into development again for which I have been doing for over 40 years now.
Ugh.  At the turn of the century--this century--I was working heavily on HTML, CSS and JavaScript on my own before they
had tools that babysat your syntax and generated shortcuts for you.  Now I am playing with getting my hands dirty with 
Node.js among other things.  Otherwise, I've been a UNIX/Linux systems person since the late 80s, as well as a database engineer since the early 90s.
